# Why React Hooks Exist?
## Introduction
React.js is the most widely used JavaScript library for front-end developers at the moment. It is utilized by developers and corporations all around the world as an open-source project.

Hooks are one of the most useful features of react. When interacting with the state, hooks allowed us to employ functional components instead of class-based components. Aside from built-in hooks, React also allows us to create our own custom hooks.

In this post, We'll look at what React Hooks are and why they're important.
# Problem :
Before react 16.8 (16 Feb 2019) developers were limited to use class-based components if they want to maintain state in the component, and functional components were used for only those components, which don't require any state.

This results in inconsistency through the app and there were several issues with class-based components.

# Issues :
The use of two different types of components created these major issues:

1. Inconsistency through the app
2. If someone wants to add states in functional

the component that requires the whole state to be converted into the class-based component.

1. To use class-based components proper 'bind' has to be maintained.

# Hooks 
Hooks actually doesn't solve the problem related to class-based components.

I just give some extra power to a functional component that allows developers to do anything with a functional component that they were already doing with class-based components.

Hooks let you always use functional components instead of having to constantly switch between functions, classes, higher-order components, and render props.

# Result
Now most developer uses functional component with hooks because:

- They can add remove states as they require.
- Hooks simplifies the development process and maintains consistency through the app.
- You no longer need to struggle with 'bind'
- Functional components became more versatile than class-based.


# Final Notes
Finally, I can guarantee you that learning React Hooks is not difficult. when I first started using react, I wasn't a big fan of hooks. But now I'm completely enamored with it.¬†
It may appear challenging at first, but as long as we focus on the fundamentals and learn how each component works, we will be able to incorporate this¬†feature with ease.¬†
Wait a minute, if you want to learn the basics of react hooks, go through this  [documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) .

In the next article of this series, I'll go through some of my favorite instances of custom hooks and how to use them in your own apps. Until then, stay tuned.
